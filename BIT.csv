With respect to Article 1(a) The notions of ""control"" over an asset and of ""pro-dominating interest"" in any entity established as a juridical person outside the jurisdiction of a Contracting State referred to in paragraphs 1, 5 and 6, relate to the exertion by an investor of a Contracting State of a controlling influence over the activities of that other juridical person, which influence results from the equity participation of the investor or from powers conferred upon him in the founding documents of such a juridical person.Contractual arrangements alone, such as for example loans, existing between the investor of a Contracting State and a third-State juridical person, do not constitute ""control"" or ""predominating interest"" in the absence of other means of control under company law. In the event the investment is made indirectly through a third-State juridical person the amount of compensation or damages due and payable to an investor of a Contracting State is prorated as to reflect his share of beneficial ownership in the capital of such a third-State juridical person.(b) Returns from the investment and, in the event of their re-investment, the returns therefrom shall enjoy the same protection and facilities as the original investment.2. With respect to Article 2(a) Investment made in accordance with legislation of either Contracting State, within the area of application of the law of that Contracting State by investors of the other Contracting State shall enjoy full protection of this Agreement.(b) Nationals authorized to work in the territory of one of the Contracting States shall be accorded the appropriate support for the exercise of their professional activities.(c) The Contracting States shall facilitate in the light of their domestic laws, regulations and administrative practices issuance of entry visas and authorizations pertaining to sojourn, work and travel of the nationals of one Contracting State pursuant to an investment in the territory of the other Contracting State.3.  With respect to Article 3(a)  The requirement to accord investments and associated activities of investors of the other Contracting State treatment not less favourable than that which a Contracting State accords in like situations to investments and associated activities of its own investors is without prejudice to the application of laws, regulations, administrative practices and procedures of each Contracting State under which the investors of the other Contracting State are allowed to invest in the territory of the first Contracting State.(b) All activities involving the purchase, sale and transport of raw and secondary materials, energy, fuels, and means of production and operations of all types shall be accorded treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the investment related activities carried out by investors of the host State or any investors of a third State, whichever is the most favourable. There shall be no impediments to the normal exercise of such activities, provided they are carried out in accordance with laws, regulations and administrative practices of the host State and in observance of the provisions of the Agreement.(c) The following shall, in particular, be deemed ""treatment less favourable"" within the meaning of Article 3: restricting the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of energy or fuel or of means of production or of operation of any kind, impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the host State, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed ""treatment less favourable"" within the meaning of Article 3.(d) The provisions of Article 3 shall not oblige a Contracting State to extend to investors resident in the territory of the other Contracting State tax privileges, tax exemptions and tax reduction which are granted only to its investors who are resident in its territory.(e) Whenever goods or persons connected with an investment are to be transported, each Contracting State shall neither exclude nor hinder transport enterprises of the other Contracting State or its investors, and shall issue permits as required to carry such transport. This shall include the transport of:(i) Goods intended for the investment within the meaning of this Agreement acquired in the territory of either Contracting State or of any third State by or on behalf of an enterprise in which assets within the meaning of this Agreement are invested;(ii) Persons travelling in connection with an investment.4.

The same procedure applies when an arbitrator is prevented from exercising his functions or in case of his resignation and the party concerned fails to appoint another arbitrator. The said arbitrators shall elect a chairman. In the event that the two arbitrators cannot agree upon the election of the person of the chairman, either of the two parties or either of the two arbitrators may invite the President of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris to appoint the chairman; if the President has the same nationality as either of the parties or if he is unable to make such appointment, this function shall be taken over by the Vide-President; and in case the Vice-President for the reasons mentioned above is unable to make such appointment the member next in seniority shall discharge that function. The chairman may neither have the same nationality as one of the parties nor have a direct economic interest in the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure, unless the two parties have agreed otherwise.(5) The costs of the arbitration shall be awarded at the entire discretion of the arbitral tribunal.(6) The Contracting Parties shall within their respective territories admit the enforcement of arbitral awards rendered unanimously or by majority by virtue of an agreement as contemplated in Article 1 of this Protocol, irrespective of whether such an award has been rendered in the territory of either Contracting Party or in the territory of a third country. The ordering and carrying through of the enforcement of such an arbitral award shall be governed by the laws of the country in which it is to be enforced.(7) To ensure the enforcement mentioned in Article 6 the party applying for enforcement shall, at the time if application, supply:(a) The original award of a duly certified copy thereof,(b) The original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof;(c) A translation of the award and the arbitration agreement, certified by an official or sworn translator or by a diplomatic or consular agent of one of the two Contracting Parties, if these two documents are not drawn up in the official language of the country in which the award is relied upon.(8) The enforcement of an arbitral award may only be refused in accordance with Article V of the Convention of the United Nations of June 10, 1958, on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.(9) Article 14, paragraph 3 of the Treaty shall be applied accordingly.DONE at Tehran, on this day of November 11th, 1965, in six originals, two in German, two in Persian and two in English, all six texts being equally authentic.
